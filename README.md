## Lane Mark Recognition 

### Steps for C++ code :

Note: For Mac os install Xquartz first and for Ubuntu install libx11-dev 
Note: Check the version and path of OpenCV. OpenCV 2 should still work.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev.
```

```bash
mkdir build

cd build 

cmake ..

make
```
Run the app:

```bash
./main (path of a video)
```
